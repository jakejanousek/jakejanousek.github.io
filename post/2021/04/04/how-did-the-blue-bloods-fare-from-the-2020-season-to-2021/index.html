<p>The 2021 College Basketball season has been hard for many especially with the COVID-19 pandemic.We have seen many teams struggle even for the Blue Bloods of league. This season we saw some of the best teams digress and not compete at the level that fans have seen them in the past. Duke and Kentucky are the top headlines as how they have struggled and each finished their seasons below .500.
Other top teams like Kansas and Villanova were good early in the year but overall digressed, and especially from last season, Kansas finished the shortened season ranked no.1. We can look at their records and say “oh well yea they digressed” but with what stats did they do worse in lead to the below average play compared to last season?
Let’s take a look at the numbers.</p>

<p>The two data sets I will be working with today are from the 2020 season and the 2021 season from Sports Reference’s website. I am going to be looking in to the stats from last season and compare them to how the Blue Bloods were this year.
The First thing I need to do is put the blue bloods together from the two data sets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bluebloods20 &lt;- logs20 %&gt;% filter(Team == &quot;Duke Blue Devils&quot; | Team == &quot;Kansas Jayhawks&quot; | Team == &quot;Villanova Wildcats&quot; | Team == &quot;Kentucky Wildcats&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>bluebloods21 &lt;- logs21 %&gt;% filter(Team == &quot;Duke&quot; | Team == &quot;Kansas&quot; | Team == &quot;Villanova&quot; | Team == &quot;Kentucky&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To start I want to to look at how they compared with their field goal percentage, a very important stat to college basketball in any season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>logs20 %&gt;% summarise(mean(TeamFGPCT))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 1

In the first graph I decided to get the average field goal percentage from this season and last year and make that the main line we want to look at. As you can see compared in the 2020 season to the 2021 the Blue Bloods were very up and down in the season of shooting from the field. They never really reached the highs from last season and was almost under the average for most of the 2021 season.
The next question I have is how they compared in points per a game from last year, another huge stat when addressing college basketball teams. In the first two data sets I created I wanted to get the average points scored throughout the season which is points per game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>points20 &lt;- bluebloods20 %&gt;% 
  group_by(Team) %&gt;% 
  summarise(ppg20 = mean(TeamScore)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(ppg20))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>points21 &lt;- bluebloods21 %&gt;% 
  group_by(Team) %&gt;% 
  summarise(ppg21 = mean(TeamScore)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(ppg21))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>bar20 &lt;- ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=points20, aes(x=reorder(Team, ppg20), weight=ppg20)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,85)) + 
  labs(
    title=&quot;How did the Blue Bloods points per game differ?&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;To no suprise points per game decreased from 2020 to 2021&quot;,
    x=&quot;Team&quot;, 
    y=&quot;Points per game 2020&quot;,

  theme(
    title = element_text(color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 13, face = &#39;bold&#39;),
    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;, fill = NA),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = &quot;blue&quot;),
    axis.text = element_text(color = &quot;blue&quot;))</code></pre>

    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = &quot;blue&quot;),
    axis.text = element_text(color = &quot;blue&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(bar20,bar21)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021/04/04/how-did-the-blue-bloods-fare-from-the-2020-season-to-2021/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" />
In this graph you can see it wasn’t a huge change from last year but all seemed to digress a bit. With Duke especially who dropped from over 80 points per game to under 70. With the overall digression in points per a game that could lead to the lower win percentage this season for them.
Next I wanted to look at a stat that could show a huge difference from last season to this season and that is cumulative point differential.
In these first two data sets I needed to get the differential and then make it cumulative.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diff20 &lt;- bluebloods20 %&gt;% 
  mutate(Differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore) %&gt;% 
  group_by(Team) %&gt;% 
  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>diff21 &lt;- bluebloods21 %&gt;% 
  mutate(Differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore) %&gt;% 
  group_by(Team) %&gt;% 
  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>step20 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_step(data=diff20, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team, color=Team)) +
  labs(
    title = &quot;The Blue Bloods could not reach their highs from last year&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;In 2021 the Blue Bloods had up and down season whereas in 2020 it was only up&quot;,
    x= &quot;Date&quot;,
    y= &quot;Cumulative Point Differential&quot;,
    caption = &quot;&quot;
  ) + theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>step21 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_step(data=diff21, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team, color=Team)) +
  labs(
    title = &quot;&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;&quot;,
    x= &quot;Date&quot;,
    y= &quot;Cumulative Point Differential&quot;,
    caption = &quot;Source: Sports-Reference | by Jacob Janousek&quot;
  ) + theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(step20,step21)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021/04/04/how-did-the-blue-bloods-fare-from-the-2020-season-to-2021/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="672" />
In this chart in 2021 it wasn’t even getting close to the 400 point differential as 2020 as it almost caps at 200. In 2020 all the Blue Bloods kept positive in cumulative Point Differential as in 2021 Duke and Kentucky were in the negative or at least close and Villanova and Kansas never got close to their highs from last season. Overall this was the most eye opening stat.
Overall some of the Blue Bloods defiantly digressed from last year. Did the COVID-19 pandemic and all that stress on players affect their play? Most likely yes because just in a year we saw some of the top Blue Bloods drop hard like Duke and Kentucky. Those teams will be back but in due time, hopefully in the future we can see these teams get back to the top and I wouldn’t be surprised if this high expectations to rebuilding year these teams will have a quick turnaround and basketball will be the same as past years where Duke,Kansas, Kentucky, and Villanova are all at the top again.</p>
